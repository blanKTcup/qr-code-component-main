## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

The majority of my learnings came from working with SASS. I learned more about how to implement SASS scripts and get everything working nicely. I had to figure out that the my dev environment src/index.html needed to link to css/style.css because, when deployed, the public/index.html would need to link accordingly. This was interesting for my head to wrap around but utimately made a lot of sense due to the separate folders and nesting of files. I also learned what .gitignore does and why it's useful.  

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about SASS and BEM. Both of these systems make CSS development very smooth and I want to feel confident that I really do understand what I am doing.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell SASS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4cECvhrBo8&pp=ygURa2V2aW4gcG93ZWxsIHNhc3M%3D) - This helped me understand SASS scripts more and how to correctly implement them.
